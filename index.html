      <h1>Origins of 1AM</h1>
      <p>Oneaftermidnight is a music group that I started in 2017 with a few of my best friends that i met at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. We became friends in 2012 and quickly found out that we all had a passion for music. Luckily, I was able to sing, Fawzan enjoyed rapping, and Ramy and Jay were hellbent on making the best beats they possibly could. Since we were only able to meet up after completing our daily commitments, we began making music every night around 1 in the morning. That specific time caught our attention, and we felt that the sound of the music we created could be described perfectly by the time it was made. Slowly but surely we honed our craft and saved up money to build our own studio. Oneaftermidnight was born! </p>

      <h1>1AM's Music Style</h2>
      <p> In terms of genre, 1AM's music falls under the category of HIpHop and r&b. This however, is a boring way to describe the music. Oneaftermidnight paints a not so hyperbolic amlgamation of the highs and lows that come with love and the lack thereof. 1AM's music can be described as the perfect music to put on your late night drive playlist. Smooth in every sense of the word is what Oneaftermidnight exemplifies in every song.

      <h1>TBH/h2>
      <p>"TBH" is one of our  most recent songs that we were able to create a music video for. It is a song that is broken up into 3 sections in which each artist delves into a seperate experience. The basis of the song is a late night setting where you are finally at odds with your partenr, and a discussion has to be had on where your relationship is going to go moving forward. "TBH" has a running time of 2 minutes and 37 seconds and I beliveve it is a perfect example of Oneaftermidnights overall vibe and music style.</p>
